My name is Robin Kiplangat. I have the following qualities:

- I'm looking forward to rocking a great mustache ðŸ˜„
- Adopted mantra :
    -   I can wait
    -   I can fast
    -   I can think

### my history

To be honest, I'm a lot of things to different people, then again ain't we all ðŸ˜„.

An idealist taking on his own hero's journey in seeking meaningful existence.

With love, respect, and support from many who continue to impact great values in my life ,I progress full of strength and balance in life.

Nurtured with inborn love of nature and a desire to understand the mysteries of life, am open to new experiences and the dense diversity aspect of being.
