My name is Robin Kiplangat. I have the following mantra:

-   I can `wait`
-   I can `fast`
-   I can `think`

### My history

To be honest, I'm a lot of things to different people, then again ain't we all 😄.

An idealist taking on his own hero's journey in seeking meaningful existence.

With love, respect, and support from many who continue to impact great values in my life ,

I progress full of strength and balance in life.

Nurtured with inborn love of nature and a desire to understand the mysteries of life, am open to new experiences and the dense diversity aspect of being.
