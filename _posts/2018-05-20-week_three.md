With a polished data exploration skills set and data that I can see and understand, <!--more-->
I need to create and build  comprehensive and understandable visualizations.

For data visualizations, I had focus on:

üìå   Plotly

üìå   Cufflinks

üìå  Geographical Plotting
    -   Choropleth Maps

### What new skills have you learned?

#### [Plotly]
---

-   Plotly is a library that allows you to create interactive plots that you    can use in dashboards or websites (you can save them as html files or static images).

Install using `pip install plotly`


#### [Cufflinks]
---
-   Cufflinks connects plotly to pandas
-   Some of the plots one can create using Cufflinks and iplot();
    -   scatter | bar | histogram
    -   box | spread | surface
    -   ratio | heatmap | bubble

Install using `pip install cufflinks`

#### Geographical plotting / [Chloropleth] Maps
---
Now you need to begin by building a data dictionary.
Easiest way to do this is to use the `dict()` function of the general form:

```jupyter
type = 'choropleth',
locations = list of states
locationmode = 'USA-states'
colorscale=
```

Example:

![dataset example](/img/plotly_example.jpeg)

```jupyter
data = dict(
        type = 'choropleth',
        locations = df['CODE'],
        z = df['GDP (BILLIONS)'],
        text = df['COUNTRY'],
        colorbar = {'title' : 'GDP Billions US'},
      )
```

Create the layout nested dictionary:

```jupyter
layout = dict(
    title = '2014 Global GDP',
    geo = dict(
        showframe = False,
        projection = {'type':'Mercator'}
    )
)
```

With the data and layout in place use `go.Figure(data = [data],layout = layout)`

to set up the object that finally gets passed into `iplot()`

```jupyter
choromap = go.Figure(data = [data],layout = layout)
iplot(choromap)
```




### What has been easy?

With the love I have for interactive plotting this was fun and we got along well.

Plotly visualizations bring out a nice touch to otherwise would be plain
vizs.

Cufflinks was utterly very new to me but there are [good documentation]
from the maintainers.

Chloropleth maps are simply darlings. With the right focus
in data exploration the possibilities are enormous


### What has been difficult?

For some reasons beyond me, `iplots` seemed not to work because of deprecated
packages in my system.

Getting my offline plot was an issue as;

``` jupyter
In[]:   cf.go_offline()

out[]:  IOPub data rate exceeded.
        The notebook server will temporarily stop sending output
        to the client in order to avoid crashing it.
        To change this limit, set the config variable
        `--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit`.

```

Plotly's mapping can be a bit hard to get used to at first remember to reference the cheat sheet or [find it online here].


### How have you used the problem solving strategies to overcome challenges so far?

Resolved to scrap, and clean data on [Mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions].

from this dataset, I took on a couple of countries mainly from East Africa.

The explorations üìá and plotting was done on [E.Africa mobile_subscriptions] notebook.

It's a milestone getting this far üë∑ and for the next one I'll be woking on a capstone
project.  

So that was the third week.. üîè
