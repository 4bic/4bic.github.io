I deem it necessary that all people be willing to sound foolish and listen to other peoples ‘foolish’ ideas.

A view from [Isaac Asimov][1] : 
>The great ideas of the ages have come from people who weren’t paid to have great ideas, but were paid to be teachers or patent clerks or petty officials, or were not paid at all.
>The great ideas came as side issues or as a result of someone else resonating with their version of foolishness

There are ocassions when I’m writing some material, some of the writing is extra insightful to the point it shocks me yet above all else I glow feeling ‘creative’ about it.


I hate memorizing stuff and am bad at it (bad is an understatement but works for now). I do not have a photographic memory. I find it easier to remember people by their unique qualities.

Am most confortable talking  to strangers for hours and not bothered that i don’t know their name / sexual orientation. Am a liberal idealist , optimistic fool who is grateful for all that
life has to offer and despite all this being dismissed kills me within.

I am so tired of the same speeches, the same disunity, the same selfishness, the same greed ,the same disregard for the planet as our only home, the same racism, the same polluted leadership,

The great ideas of the ages have come from people who weren’t paid to have great ideas, but were paid to be teachers or patent clerks or petty officials, or were not paid at all.
The great ideas came as side issues or as a result of someone else resonating with their version of foolishness

cut them some slack

It’s the creative individuals who made life safer and more enjoyable if not at least bearable, we have medicine, communication, transportation, information, education, and a whole list of other elements.


Funny how that works, Its hard to understand that there are those who just want to burn it all down. They seem to prevail quite often throughout history, and nobody has been creative enough to find a way to stop it.


War, cruelty, oppression are just as prevalent now as ever. In other words, the human is still stuck in a bad evolutionary stage, and the small percentage or humans who are attempting to get us to the next level are vastly outnumbered.

build rather than break

Creative people really need a lot of self confidence to pursue creative ideas without being branded stupid, obscene and my favorite foolish since encouragement is rarely forthcoming.

>“ Our ancient ancestors had this ability naturally or we wouldn’t be here today. We’ve lost that ability because of our emphasis on and glorification of the intellect, the thinking brain.
>We are seriously misusing our brain by over-thinking everything which causes an overload of fear, because fear is only thought and it blocks our creative mind.”     — starwyze 

It's that time to rise up

New things threaten the established order, true , as such dealing with self doubt would be a first step in raising suggestions that bubble from within.
>"What if I did this? What if I tried that? Every day we are faced with barriers to overcome…. And, there is no manual to tell us what to do. We have to identify the right problem first. Then find a solution.“ — Dick Kline


The key, the trick, the true understanding comes in asking the right question, posing the right problem to be solved. Understanding the context for solutions and the origin of the task are important.


I’d encourage you to learn one new thing, add to the depth of knowledge you possess and pass on that knowledge to someone else for a better human race and **thats the magic pill**
