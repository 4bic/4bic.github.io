What Lies forth in a skills journey? and is fairly ok good enough?

<!--more-->
Inspired by [Robert Chang]'s journey ,  I read [Plateau of Productivity] which in an elaboration of skills journey, not a new concept but Iâ€™ve always had my own reservations.

I have a pretty good working knowledge of the python language and need not say that there are obviously
a lot more things that I need to learn.

My major appeal of Python is the Data Analysis part as the beauty of using Python for data work is that you have a higher chance to see how data plays a role within the whole integrated technology stack.

## Motivation

Knowing Better Python is likely to make me a better **end-to-end** Data Scientist and better Software Engineer.

## My Deliberate Practice

Learn by doing is the loudest advice I've heard so far and am going to hone my Python skills through Deliberate Practice:

### Identify the Top Performers.

*   I think I know a few people who can be my role model.
*   I 'll  need to understand what they've been through to 	get to where they are today.
*   What is their mental representation that I do not have about Python.

### Build Practice Plans.

-   Ideally, based on the rough understanding of that mental representation.
-   Define clear goals and select learning materials
-   Create deadline and milestones for the project
-   Estimate time required and come up weekly schedules
-   Augment these insights with my current level of mental representation of Python to improve my understanding.

### Targeted Practice.

-   Force myself to work everyday for an hour
-   Maximize my time practicing Python for Data 	Analysis
-    Work on Data visualization, Modeling, and contribute to 	Python Data Analysis packages.

### Immediate Feedbacks.

Create a culture of code reviews.
-   Find constant opportunities to get feedback as much as possible.
