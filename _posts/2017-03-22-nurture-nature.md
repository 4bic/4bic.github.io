 I must admit that I'm grateful for the much i've been able to accomplish and <!--more-->
shocked that  its only been a year considering everything that has been coming through.

>How comes I've been this prosperous?

>What is it that I did or that am doing that has allowed me the liberty?

I've questioned myself countless of times, although I know I played a part but its never all up to an individual to make all the wheels turn.

In the pursuit of keeping self accountable, i realized stepping out of your successes allows us to have a grasp of the world around us. Its in these small victories that we get blinded of the bigger tasks ahead.

Deuces ,   its been real …..
