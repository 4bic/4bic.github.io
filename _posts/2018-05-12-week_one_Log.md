Having set out to build practice plans, for the first week,
I had set out the following goals:

*   Work on python basics for data analysis
-   Intro to Numpy.
*   Pandas Basics

### What new skills have you learned?

#### Numpy
---

-   Numpy is powerful in reference to basic routines
    for manipulating large arrays and matrices of numeric data.
-   Here is the [numpy notebook] I worked on:
    -   Generating Random Numbers
    -   Indexing and selection
    -   Slicing and operations to manipulate matrices.

#### Pandas
---
-   Pandas provides rich data structures and functions designed to make working
    with structured data fast, easy, and expressive.
-   In the [pandas notebook], I was able to look at:
    -   Series and DataFrames
    -   Multi-Index and Index Hierarchy
    -   Merging, Joining and Concatenating
    -   Missing Data, Groupby and aggregate
    -   Cross Section selection over levels
    -   I / O operations

### What has been easy?

Being conversant with Python, I blazed through the introductions and got
to Numpy and Pandas.

Working on data manipulation with Pandas was quite enjoyable and I got to explore
lots of functionalities that previously passed me.

### What has been difficult?

Running operations a day after learning them was a challenge and constantly had to reference
the documentations for help.

### How have you used the problem solving strategies to overcome challenges so far?

#####    Numpy

-   Comfortable to work with.
-   Generate & manipulate arrays 

#####    Pandas

-   Able to import [sample datasets] from Kaggle and worked some magic.
