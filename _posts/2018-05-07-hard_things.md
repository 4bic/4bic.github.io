  [Ben Horowitz] in *[Hard Thing about Hard Things]* speaks of having been brought up in a fairly conserved family and had to break off many barriers that  conflicted with his experiences as a CEO. 
<!--more-->

The book starts of giving a background of his humble upbringing which lays out some of the challenges that his entrepreneurial journey had to overcome as he advanced.

Finding a deep connection with the author some of the highlights for me were ;

### Zero formulas

Circumstances within a startup / business will constantly evolve and as such it is best to adapt to the situations and adopt a mechanism that is dynamic for sustenance

### Build
 Be ready to create something out of nothing. This stands out as a big pillar that informs about how in business, most times our dreams conflict with reality and its during such times, that one is expected to suck it up and find a way through it.

### Shift your view points 
As CEO of a startup, sorting out of issues is one of your obligations, this notwithstanding, sharing of problems with others internally / externally will allow others to assist with other perspectives possible to your problem. If this doesn’t help, atlas you’ll have someplace to vent out :)

### Focus 
Sticking to one’s /organization’s goals is very key to keep a company from shifting directions and keeping afloat especially during rough patches

### Straightforwardness 
Most companies go through moments that are quite tough and as the CEO, its your obligation to relay this information to your employees / stakeholders in the most direct form without lying about it.

### Prioritize 
People, products and profits. This is the order recommended and elaborates on how a well catered for workforce is motivated to provide great goods / services to which customers will be satisfied.
When this is the case satisfied customers means better sales which results to bigger profits.
