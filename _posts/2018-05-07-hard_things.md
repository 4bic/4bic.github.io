Every individual / organizational journey has to overcome or adapt to challenges
in ways unique to itself

 [Ben Horowitz] in *[Hard Thing about Hard Things]* speaks of having been brought up in a fairly conserved family and had to break off many barriers that conflicted with his experiences as a CEO.

From his humble upbringing, he lays out some of the challenges that his entrepreneurial journey had to overcome as he advanced.

Finding a deep connection with the author, I draw 6 lessons from Hard Thing about Hard Things.

### Zero formulas

Circumstances within a startup / business will constantly evolve and as such it is best to adapt to the situations and adopt a mechanism that is dynamic for sustenance

### Build.

Be ready to create something out of nothing. This stands out as a big pillar that informs how in business, most times our dreams conflict with reality and its during such times, one is expected to suck it up and find a way through it.

### Shift your view points

As CEO of a startup, sorting out of issues is one of your obligations, this notwithstanding, sharing of problems with others internally / externally will allow others to assist you with different perspectives possible to your problem. If this doesn’t help, alas you’ll have someplace to vent out :)

### Focus

Sticking to one’s /organization’s goals is very key to keep a company from shifting directions and keeping afloat especially during rough patches

### Straightforwardness

Most companies go through moments that are quite tough and as the CEO, its your obligation to relay this information to your employees / stakeholders in the most direct form without lying about it.

### Prioritize .

People, products and profits. This is the order recommended and elaborates on how a well catered for workforce is motivated to provide great goods / services to which customers will be satisfied.
When this is the case satisfied customers means better sales which results to bigger profits.
