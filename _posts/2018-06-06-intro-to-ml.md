Machine learning has not been easy to pick up and there has been lots of detours that
I took all in supplementing the depth of knowledge that I thought I'd need.

### What new skills have you learned?

#### Machine learning.
>    Machine Learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn . . . without being explicitly programmed. - Wikipedia

For more than a week, I looked at the introduction and uses of ML and lots of correlated
disciplines within the field and it can get easily overwhelming.

Now that I've explored the data a bit, working on advancement and furthering research on this
is crucial at informing further what data is all about.

#### [Linear Regression].
What I have picked up under Linear Regression.

Linear regression or Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is the simplest and most classic linear method for regression.

-   Linear models are models that make a prediction using a linear function of the input features.
-   Linear models for regression can be characterized as regression models for which the prediction is a line for a single feature, a plane when using two features, or a hyperplane in higher dimensions (that is when having more features).

###### Concepts
```jupyter
Finding the most correlated feature with Training and Testing Data

Model Training & fitting data.

Predicting Test Data
```
Having been able to fit a model, the next step is to evaluate its performance by predicting off the test values!

Evaluate the model performance by calculating the `residual sum of squares` and the `explained variance score` (R^2).

Calculate;
```jupyter
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error  
Root Mean Squared Error
```
In essence finding a correlation between elements is about interpreting relationships between coefficients.
